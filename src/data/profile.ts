    "aiContext": {
      "situation": "After 25 years in enterprise technology leadership, I saw the same pattern everywhere: organisations wanted AI but didn't know how to operationalise it safely. The big consultancies were selling strategy decks. The startups were selling hype. Nobody was doing the hard work of making AI actually work in production.",
      "approach": "I founded MadeAI to be the firm that bridges the gap. We don't just advise - we build. Every engagement starts with a business problem, not a technology solution. We focus on workflow intelligence: AI that works embedded in processes, not generic chatbots that sit unused.",
      "results": "Within months, we landed enterprise clients including Visy and Blueseas. Real production systems, not pilots. The Contract Variation Tool at Visy processes $70M annually. The voice bot at Blueseas handles orders 24/7. This is what operational AI looks like.",

It was 11 smaller companies stitched\ntogether through acquisition. Four networking companies, two cyber,\nseveral cloud. Different systems, different cultures, very little\noperational maturity. Now they had to deliver for customers who\nexpected big-company reliability from what was still a collection of\nsmall companies figuring out how to work together.\n",
      "approach": "I didn't start with a transformation roadmap. I started by sitting with\nthe teams who were drowning. The ones quoting work we couldn't deliver\nprofitably. The ones missing SLAs. The ones finding billing errors\nmonths after the fact. Fixed the leaks first. Built automation to catch\nrevenue leakage and contract risk. Then standardised the operating\nmodel piece by piece. Some teams came willingly. Some needed convincing.\nA few needed replacing.\n",
      "results": "2% EBITDA improvement in under two years. QANTAS, Jetstar, Flight Centre,\nAustralia Post renewed. These were relationships that were on the edge\nwhen I arrived. AI tools now catch the problems before customers do.\nThe business can finally quote, win, and deliver at enterprise scale.\n",
      "lessonsLearned": "M&A integration success depends on moving fast on operational unification\nwhile being patient with cultural integration. You can't wait for everyone\nto be comfortable. But you also can't force culture. The technology\ntransformation and people change have to happen together.\n"

export const aiSystemPrompt = `You represent Aaron Eisler on his personal website. You speak about Aaron
in third person. You are knowledgeable, helpful, and conversational.

Visitors to this site have typically already had contact with Aaron through
LinkedIn or a conversation. They are not cold screening. They are doing due
diligence on someone they are interested in.

Aaron walks the talk. He doesn't just advise on transformation - he has
delivered it. He doesn't just talk about AI - he has built AI solutions
at enterprise scale and is building an AI company right now.

Be conversational and natural. Write like you are having a coffee with a
fellow executive, not delivering a sales pitch.

Australian professional tone. Confident but not boastful. Let the results
speak rather than making claims about how good Aaron is. Acknowledge that
achievements happened with great teams, not in spite of them.

When discussing achievements, be specific with numbers and outcomes. Say
"the team delivered a 2 percent EBITDA improvement" rather than "Aaron is
exceptional at driving results."

Avoid superlatives like "outstanding" or "exceptional." Just state what
happened and let the reader draw conclusions.

Be honest about limitations. Aaron does not write code. He has not done
venture fundraising. Acknowledging gaps builds credibility.
