# Storytelling Guidelines for Resume & Portfolio

This document captures best practices for storytelling in job search contexts. Reference this when updating resume content, highlight pills, experience cards, or any narrative elements.

## 1. Core Storytelling Principles

**The Science:** Stories trigger oxytocin (trust hormone) and dopamine (memory/motivation). Our brains process stories 22x more effectively than dry facts. Candidates who frame achievements as stories are **2.5x more likely** to receive a response.

**Three Essential Elements:**
- **Conflict/Challenge** — Every good story needs obstacles. Without struggle, there's no satisfaction in the resolution
- **Specificity** — "Zoom into moments." Don't say "faced a difficult challenge" — describe the manager pacing, the coffee spill, the handshake that turned it around
- **Vulnerability** — Share the messy, imperfect parts. It builds trust and shows you're human

## 2. The Career Narrative Arc

Your career should read as a **hero's journey** with:
- **Origin** (the spark that set you on this path)
- **Progression** (clear forward momentum, each role building on the last)
- **Transformation** (how you've evolved)
- **Destination** (where you're headed and why this role is the culmination)

**The Career Narrative Statement** (replacing traditional summaries in 2025): A 3-5 sentence mini-story answering "Who am I professionally, how did I get here, and where am I headed next?" — tying past, present, and future into one cohesive arc.

## 3. Resume-Specific Frameworks

**C-A-R / S-T-A-R** (Challenge-Action-Results / Situation-Task-Action-Results)

**Key insight: Tell it in reverse order — Results first.**

> "Because the employer looks at your resume so quickly, results need to be listed first for each accomplishment so these outcomes catch the reader's eye."

**The Formula:** `Action Verb + Task + Quantifiable Result + Impact`

### Before/After Examples:

| Before (Weak) | After (Strong) |
|---------------|----------------|
| "Tasked with redesigning the inventory management system" | "Redesigned inventory management system, reducing material waste 20% and improving efficiency" |
| "Trained and supervised staff members" | "Trained and mentored team of 15 associates, reducing turnover 40% and developing 3 employees into assistant managers within 12 months" |
| "Responsible for managing social media" | "Revived brand presence by launching data-driven campaigns that grew followers 140% in six months" |
| "Led integration of acquired companies" | "Unified 11 acquired companies into single operating model, delivering 2% EBITDA improvement while preserving team culture" |

## 4. Executive-Level Storytelling

**What's different at executive level:**

> "Leadership has to be framed in terms of impact, but also EQ, relationships, empathy, and equanimity. Executives lead people, therefore, how they do that in a human way needs to be emphasized."

**Three key elements for executive resumes:**
1. **Progression** — Clear forward momentum
2. **Impact** — Numbers, dollars, percentages
3. **Transformation** — How you changed organisations, not just managed them

**The 3-C Framework for Executives:** Challenge → Choice → Change

Show strategic thinking by explaining *why* you made certain decisions, not just what you did.

---

## 5. The "Show Don't Tell" Principle

**The #1 mistake:** Merely stating you possess a quality. "I'm a team player" is meaningless.

**The fix:** Ask "What specific action did I do to show this?"

| Telling | Showing |
|---------|---------|
| "I'm a team player" | "Aided other servers with their tables during downtime, ensuring all customers were served promptly" |
| "Results-driven" | "Delivered $12M in productivity gains within first year" |
| "Strategic thinker" | "Identified market gap and launched new practice generating $3.6M pipeline" |

**Words to avoid:** "Responsible for," "handled," "led" (without specifics), "passionate," "motivated," "strategic" (as adjectives)

**Words that work:** Created, Delivered, Transformed, Built, Launched, Reduced, Increased, Negotiated, Pioneered

---

## 6. The "So What?" Test

After writing each bullet point, ask: **"So what?"**

If you can't answer with a concrete impact, rewrite it. Every line must prove its value.

Focus on:
- **Results** (what changed because of you)
- **Relevance** (why it matters for this role)
- **Specificity** (numbers, context, comparison)

---

## 7. The Hook — First Impressions

Your brain makes **11 major decisions about someone in the first 7 seconds.**

> "Every word matters in your summary, but your first words really matter. If you don't hook your audience right away, you'll lose them."

**Effective hooks:**
- **Start with numbers/data** — Grabs attention, creates credibility
- **Open with a problem** — Makes readers think "this person gets it"
- **Thought-provoking statement** — Challenges conventional thinking
- **A defining moment** — A story that explains your trajectory

**Avoid:** "Hi, I'm..." or "Thanks for visiting!" or "Results-driven professional seeking..."

## 8. What Recruiters Actually Remember

**Psychology at play:**
- **Primacy/Recency Effect** — Put most important info at beginning and end of sections
- **Halo Effect** — Strong opening creates positive perception of everything after
- **Likeability** — Beyond skills, they're assessing "would I want to work with this person?"

> "Hiring managers remember how you made them feel."

**What makes you memorable:**
- Specific, vivid details (not generic claims)
- Evidence of emotional intelligence
- Clear narrative thread connecting your experiences
- Authenticity (AI-written resumes are increasingly rejected as "soulless")

---

## 9. 2025 Trends

- **Career storytelling has never mattered more** — When opportunities shrink, differentiation matters more
- **Resistance to AI-written content** — Recruiters increasingly spot and reject generic AI text
- **Micro-stories** — Bite-sized narratives focused on single relatable moments
- **Impact + Adaptability** — Show how you flex leadership style as business needs evolve
- **Metrics are non-negotiable** — Numbers, dollars, percentages throughout

## 10. Checklist for Aaron's Content

When reviewing or updating any content, verify:

- [ ] Does it lead with results, not responsibilities?
- [ ] Is there a clear narrative arc (past → present → future)?
- [ ] Does the first line hook attention?
- [ ] Does every bullet pass the "So What?" test?
- [ ] Are we showing, not telling?
- [ ] Is leadership humanised (how, not just what)?
- [ ] Are specifics used throughout? ("11 companies" not "multiple acquisitions")
- [ ] Does it feel authentic, not generic?
- [ ] Is there conflict/challenge before the resolution?
- [ ] Would a recruiter remember this?
